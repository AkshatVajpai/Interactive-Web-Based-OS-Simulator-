# Progress Report: Interactive Web-Based OS Simulator

## Project Overview
The Interactive Web-Based OS Simulator is a comprehensive web application designed to demonstrate and visualize various operating system concepts, including process scheduling algorithms and deadlock detection. The project aims to provide an educational tool for understanding complex OS concepts through interactive visualizations.

## Current Progress

  - First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Priority Scheduling
  - Round Robin Scheduling
- Developed interactive Gantt chart visualization
- Added performance metrics calculation
- Created user-friendly input interface

#### Resource Allocation Graph (RAG) Simulator
- Implemented interactive graph visualization
- Added process and resource management functionality
- Developed request and allocation edge creation
- Implemented deadlock detection with cycle analysis
- Created visual feedback for deadlocked nodes

#### Technical Implementation
